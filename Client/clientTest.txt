From the coursework specifications, a test url, http://posttestserver.com/ was given to test the client. Using this url, I sent each of the various requests,
GET method, HEAD method and the 2 different input for POST methods to the url.
The method names are as follows, httpGet, httpHead and httpPost.

From the GET request, I got the response header and the response body from the server. 
From the HEAD request, I got only the response header from the server.
From the POST request, I managed to send a String input and later an ArrayList input to the server and store it on the server. The server then sent back a response 
link. Using this response link, I managed to retrieve and review the stored data on the server.

After that, I created a new JUnit class called G52APRClientTests to test the client again.
In this JUnit class, I have created 4 test methods. These methods connect to the server at port 4444 and compare the response got back from the server to the
expected response. 

Test Get Request Method : testGetRequest()
	Response got from server : "HTTP/1.0 501 GET Not Implemented" (expected response)
	
Test Head Request Method : testHeadRequest()
	Response got from server : "HTTP/1.0 501 HEAD Not Implemented" (expected response)
	
Test Post Request Method : testPostRequestString() - Sent a String input to the server
	Response got from server : "HTTP/1.0 501 POST Not Implemented" (expected response)
	
Test Post Request Method : testPostRequestArrayList() - Sent an ArrayList input to the server
	Response got from server : "HTTP/1.0 501 POST Not Implemented" (expected response)
	
I have attached this JUnit class in my submitted files. I have used both testing methods to test my code.All the request methods got the expected response.
